A simple web-page that shows you the local weather. It uses the [OpenWeather current weather API](http://openweathermap.org/current).

## Instructions
To make the thing work put your OpenWeatherAPI key in js/script.js as shown below:

```javascript
var apiUrl = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?APPID=";
var appID = "YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE";
...
```
